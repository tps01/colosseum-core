# Historical documentation archive

Normative documentation for Colosseum is:

- [docs/scope.md](../scope.md) — implemented behavior and deferred items
- [docs/sphinx/source/guides/](../sphinx/source/guides/) — user guides (built by docgen)
- [examples/configs/](../../examples/configs/) — bench TOML patterns
- Runtime code and generated bench config reference (`python scripts/docgen/build_all.py`)

Early planning documents (ADRs, FFOs, DDDs) were removed from the tracked tree to reduce
feature-creep and doc drift. Recover them from git history when needed, for example:

```bash
git log --oneline -- docs/archive/planning/
git show <commit>:docs/archive/planning/design/ddd-equipment-vsg-speca.md
```
