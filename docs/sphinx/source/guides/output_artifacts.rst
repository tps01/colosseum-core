Output artifacts
================

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - File
     - Description
   * - ``debug.log``
     - Run header and execution log
   * - ``execution.sqlite``
     - Measurements, verifications, events, metadata, and registered artifacts
   * - ``summary.txt``
     - End-of-run human summary (written by ``col.endex()``)
   * - ``summary.json``
     - End-of-run machine-readable summary (written by ``col.endex()``)

The output directory is created on first log or database write. Suite runs use the suite ``name`` as the directory stem. Disable persisted output with ``--no-artifacts``, ``load_config(..., no_artifacts=True)``, or ``COLOSSEUM_NO_ARTIFACTS=1`` (see :doc:`running_tests`).

Plugin-generated files (for example spectrum trace CSV, IQ capture binaries, screenshots) are written under the same output directory. Equipment APIs register them in the ``artifacts`` SQLite table via ``register_artifact``. RF trace files from ``col.equipment.speca.save_trace_data`` typically live at ``traces/<name>.csv`` relative to the run directory.

Use :func:`col.database.read_verifications` for inspection only; do not use read helpers to decide pass/fail (use ``col.endex()``). For completed runs, use ``colosseum.database.read_from_path.read_from_path(...)`` to inspect an ``execution.sqlite`` file without an active runtime.
